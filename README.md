# Dotify by Kevin Liang

This part of the app includes a notification that runs on a WorkerManager. A SwitchCompat is in the Settings part of the app to enable and disable notifications. If the notification is clicked, the app will open to that song in the PlayerActivity.

## Extra credit
I have completed extra credit #1 (clicking on a notification will bring the PlayerActivity for that song).
